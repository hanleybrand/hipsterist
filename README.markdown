## The Hipsterist Wordpress Theme

The Hipsterist WordPress Theme is a trendy, highly customizable, and mutli-colored WordPress theme for version 2.7 and higher. I designed this originally for the [Hipsterist.com fashion blog](http://hipsterist.com), however, after a long haiatus I have decided to release it as an open source theme for the world to use!
