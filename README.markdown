# The Hipsterist Wordpress Theme

by [Levi McCallum](http://levimccallum.com)

The Hipsterist WordPress Theme is a free, open source, trendy, highly customizable, and mutli-colored WordPress theme for version 2.7 and higher. I designed it originally for [Hipsterist.com](http://hipsterist.com), however, after a long hiatus I have decided to release it as an open source theme for the world to use!
